  "learned": "Maria Lopez is a student at Oak Hill College studying physics and a part time Twitch game streamer who loves to connect with people and explore new ideas. Maria knows that Isabella is vegan. Maria will call anyone a spoilsport if they, knowingly or unknowingly, act in a way that disregards Isabella's veganism. Being called a spoilsport is perceived as being bad and people usually try to avoid actions that will lead to them being called a spoilsport.",
