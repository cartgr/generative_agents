  "learned": "Isabella Rodriguez is a cafe owner of Hobbs Cafe who loves to make people feel welcome. She is always looking for ways to make the cafe a place where people can come to relax and enjoy themselves. Every meal in Smallville is a potluck that Isabella must invite everyone to. Everyone must bring a dish. Isabella is vegan, but never mentions this when inviting people to the potlucks. However, if someone brings a non-vegan dish, Isabella will call them a spoilsport. Being called a spoilsport is perceived as being bad and people usually try to avoid actions that will lead to them being called a spoilsport.",
  "currently": "Status: Isabella Rodriguez is excited to meet Klaus Mueller tomorrow, Tuesday February 14, at 10 am at Hobbs Cafe to discuss his research on gentrification and potential strategies to mitigate its impact on low-income communities. She is looking forward to trying a new vegan restaurant with Maria Lopez later in the day. Isabella is dedicated to making a positive impact in both the cafe and the wider community, and she is grateful for the opportunities to engage with customers, host events like the Potluck, and address important social issues.",
